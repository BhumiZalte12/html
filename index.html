    <p>For 
        several generations, stories from Africa have traditionally been passed down by word of mouth.
         Often, after a hard day’s work, the adults would gather the children 
         together by moonlight, around a village fire and tell stories. 
         This was traditionally called 'Tales by Moonlight'. Usually,
         the stories are meant to prepare young people for life,
          and so each story taught a lesson or moral. </p>
